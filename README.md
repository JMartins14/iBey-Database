# iBey-Database


Database of an inverted auction where buyers indicate what they intend to acquire and are the sellers to make the bids. The seller who offers the lowest value wins. In this type of auction the price goes down as the bids are made, unlike the usual. This project consists of developing a database of a typical auction system, but in order to support inverted auctions.


<b> This project was developed under a chair of the 3rd year of the University of Coimbra by a group of 3 students </b>
